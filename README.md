Dam Operations, Flow, and Temperature Analysis (2015 & 2023)

This Shiny app explores the relationship between dam operations, flow, and water temperatures in the Licking River. The app utilizes data from:

Data Loggers: Water temperature data collected from data loggers placed in the Licking River and its South Fork tributary. The South Fork serves as a "natural source" for comparison.

USGS Gauges: Flow and temperature data from various USGS gauges, providing additional context for "natural" conditions and highlighting the variability across different river systems and the impact of infrastructure.

The app focuses on data from 2015 and 2023, allowing users to investigate changes and trends over time.

Interactive Features:


Interactive Plots: Explore the relationships between dam operations, flow, and temperature using interactive plots.

Data Filtering: Filter data by year and location to focus on specific aspects of the analysis.


Purpose:

This app aims to provide insights into how dam operations influence water temperatures in the Licking River, using the South Fork and other USGS gauges as reference points for natural conditions. By understanding these relationships, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding dam management and water resource planning.

Note:

The variability in natural sources is due to the different river systems they represent and the presence of infrastructure in some of those rivers. This highlights the importance of considering multiple reference points when assessing the impact of dam operations on water temperature.
